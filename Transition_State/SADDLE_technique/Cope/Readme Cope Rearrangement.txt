These data sets show how to locate and characterize the  
transition state for the Cope rearrangement:
1,5 hexadiene => 1,5 hexadiene
See: Cope.gif

First, the reactants are optimized, data set:
1-5_hexadiene reactant cope.mop

The products are then optimized, data set:
1-5_hexadiene product cope.mop

The product is optimized using the reactant as the reference geometry, data set:
1-5_hexadiene product for slope.mop

This gives rise to a product geometry on the slope 
leading up to the transition state, data set:
1-5_hexadiene product on slope.mop  (This calculation is not run)

Then the reactant is optimized using the product geometry 
on the slope from the last calculation, data set:
1-5_hexadiene reactant for slope.mop

At this point, there are two strategies for getting nearer to the transition state.  
If option (A) works, then the transition state is located, and the job is complete.
If (A) does not work, use option (B).

(A) Generate the average of the geometries on both sides of the 
transition state on the slope.  This uses the geometries generated by:
1-5_hexadiene product for slope.mop
and
1-5_hexadiene reactant for slope.mop
This data set is called:
1-5_hexadiene for average geo_ref.mop
When it is run (very fast) it generates a new file:
1-5_HEXADIENE PRODUCT ON SLOPE.new
Edit this file to remove the keyword GEO_REF, and name the resulting file:
1-5_Hexadiene from GEO_REF.mop


(B) Use the geometries on the slope on both sides of the transition state 
to set up a SADDLE calculation, data set:
1-5_hexadiene saddle.mop

The resulting geometry is very close to the transition state.  
Refinement, characterisation, and mapping of the Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate
can all be done in one job, data set:
1-5_Hexadiene from GEO_REF.mop   (From option A)
1-5_hexadiene Refine and characterize transition state.mop  (From option B)

The AVI file shows the energy - reaction coordinate.
The xyz file is intended to be visualized using Jmol.
