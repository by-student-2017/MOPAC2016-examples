
A: ortho
         :  heat of formation
Reactions: -118.525 kcal/mol
TS       : -115.159 kcal/mol
Products : -117.280 kcal/mol

Activation energy = E(TS) - E(Reactions)
  = -115.159 - -118.525 = 3.366 [kcal/mol]


B: para
         :  heat of formation
Reactions: -120.803 kcal/mol
TS       : -112.346 kcal/mol
Products : -114.075 kcal/mol

Activation energy = E(TS) - E(Reactions)
  = -112.34 - -120.803 = 8.463 [kcal/mol]

Note
  Since the activation energy is lower in the ortho position, 
it means that the ortho position is prioritized in terms of kinetics.
  This calculation result agrees with the experimental result that 
the ortho form has priority at low temperature.
