
         : heat of formation
Reactants: 200.140 kcal/mol
TS       : 206.849 kcal/mol
Products : 168.101 kcal/mol

Activation energy = E(TS) - E(Reactants)
  = 206.849 - 200.140 = 6.709 [kcal/mol]

Note
  Since the activation energy required for the rearrangement reaction is quite small, 
it is expected that the primary carbonium ion will be easily rearranged to the tertiary carbonium ion.
